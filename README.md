* Name and partners name(At most teams of 2 folks total)
  * Team member 1: Alex Yuan
* How many hours did it take you to complete this final project? 
  * 50 hours
* Did you collaborate or share ideas with any other students/TF/ULA/Professors? 
  * I went to Alvin Shi's office hours.
* Did you use any external resources? 
  * https://learnopengl.com/In-Practice/2D-Game/Particles (Introduction to Particle System)
  * YouTube - SimpleMatrix (Water and Reflection Tutorial in OpenGL)
* (Optional) What was the most interesting part of the Final Assignment? How could the instructor improve the final project?
  * This final assignment was super cool. It allowed me to explore new techniques that we covered in class but never formally practiced in any sort of assignment. I was able to use my creativity to replicate a scene from my childhood of watching fireworks over our neighborhood golf course. This project allowed me to relive those memories, and I'm super happy I could do so while also implementing some really cool techniques. Honestly, there isn't really much that can be done to improve this final project. I loved how I could be creative and do what I wanted to do!
